from visdat package\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can you find out what other datasets are included with ggplot2?\nTo find out what datasets are included with the ggplot2 package, you can use the data() function. You can use the data() function to list all the datasets available in the ggplot2 package.\n\nCodedata(package = \"ggplot2\")\n\n\n\nApart from the US, most countries use fuel consumption (fuel consumed over fixed distance) rather than fuel economy (distance travelled with fixed amount of fuel). How could you convert cty and hwy into the European standard of l/100km?\nIn the R formula, we convert miles per gallon (mpg) to liters per 100 kilometers (L/100km). The conversion factor, 235.21, is used to perform the conversion. To convert mpg to L/100km, we divide the conversion factor by the mpg value.\n\\[ \\text{L/100km} = \\frac{235.21}{\\text{mpg}}  \\tag{1}\\] The conversion factor of 235.21 is derived from the following logic:\n\n1 mile is equal to approximately 1.609 kilometers.\n1 gallon is equal to approximately 3.785 liters.\n\nTo convert from miles per gallon (mpg) to liters per 100 kilometers (L/100km), we need to reverse the units. So, we divide the number of miles (1 mile) by the number of gallons (1 gallon) to get the number of kilometers per liter. This can be expressed as:\n\\[ \\text{Kilometers per Liter} = \\frac{1 \\text{ mile}}{1 \\text{ gallon}} \\times \\frac{1.609 \\text{ kilometers}}{1 \\text{ mile}} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ liter}}{3.785 \\text{ gallons}} \\approx 0.4251 \\text{ kilometers per liter}  \\tag{2}\\]\nNow, to express fuel efficiency in liters per 100 kilometers, we need to scale up by 100:\n\\[ \\text{L/100km} = \\frac{1}{0.4251} \\times 100 \\approx 235.21 \\text{ L/100km per 1 kilometer per liter}  \\tag{3}\\]\nSo, when you divide 235.21 by miles per gallon (mpg), you are effectively converting from miles per gallon to liters per 100 kilometers, accounting for the differences in units and scaling by 100 to express the consumption over a distance of 100 kilometers.\nNow, you can include the R code and LaTeX explanation in an R Markdown document for a more structured presentation. When you knit the R Markdown document, it will generate a formatted document with both the code and explanations.\n\nCode# Conversion factor from mpg to L/100km\nconversion_factor &lt;- 235.21\n\nmpg |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    cty = conversion_factor/cty,\n    hwy = conversion_factor/hwy\n  ) |&gt; \n  slice_head(n = 5) |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; gtExtras::gt_theme_538() |&gt; \n  fmt_number(columns = cty:hwy,\n             decimals = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1:  mpg dataset with mileage in Liters per 100 km \n  \nmanufacturer\n      model\n      displ\n      year\n      cyl\n      trans\n      drv\n      cty\n      hwy\n      fl\n      class\n    \n\n\naudi\na4\n1.8\n1999\n4\nauto(l5)\nf\n13.07\n8.11\np\ncompact\n\n\naudi\na4\n1.8\n1999\n4\nmanual(m5)\nf\n11.20\n8.11\np\ncompact\n\n\naudi\na4\n2.0\n2008\n4\nmanual(m6)\nf\n11.76\n7.59\np\ncompact\n\n\naudi\na4\n2.0\n2008\n4\nauto(av)\nf\n11.20\n7.84\np\ncompact\n\n\naudi\na4\n2.8\n1999\n6\nauto(l5)\nf\n14.70\n9.05\np\ncompact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich manufacturer has the most models in this dataset?

What’s the difference between geom_path() and geom_line()?\ngeom_path() and geom_polygon() are both used for creating line-based plots, but they serve different purposes. geom_line() is another geom used for line-based plots, and I’ll explain the differences between these geoms: —\n\n\ngeom_path():\n\n\ngeom_path() connects data points in the order they appear in the data frame. It’s used to create a path or line that may not necessarily form a closed shape.\n\ngeom_path() is typically used for visualizing trajectories, paths, or any data where the order of points matters.\nIn Figure 1 (a) , geom_path() connects the points in the order of their row numbers in the data, i.e. (1,1) -&gt; (2,3) -&gt; (3,1) -&gt; (2,0) -&gt; (1,1) in that order.\n\n\n\ngeom_polygon():\n\n\ngeom_polygon() is used to create filled shapes by connecting data points in the order they appear. It forms a closed path and fills the area inside.\nIt’s commonly used for creating filled polygons, like shapes on a map or shaded areas in plots.\nIn Figure 1 (b) , geom_polygon() connects the points (1,1) -&gt; (2,3) -&gt; (3,1) -&gt; (2,0) -&gt; (1,1) in that order, forming a closed shape, and fills the area inside the shape.\n\n\n\ngeom_line():\n\n\ngeom_line() is used to create a line chart by connecting data points in the order they appear on the plot axis. It is used to show trends or connections between data points, irrespective of their row number in the data frame from which they came from.\nIn Figure 1 (c) , geom_line() connects the points (1,1) -&gt; (2,3) -&gt; (2,0) -&gt; (3,1) in that order along the increasing values of x-axis variable “x”.\n\n\n\n\nCodelibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(cowplot)\n\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  x = c(1, 2, 3, 2, 1),\n  y = c(1, 3, 1, 0, 1),\n  label = paste0(\"Observation \", 1:5)\n)\n\nggplot(df, aes(x, y, label = label)) +\n  geom_path() +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel() +\n  labs(title = \"geom_path()\") +\n  theme_minimal_grid()\n\nggplot(df, aes(x, y, label = label)) +\n  geom_polygon(fill = \"lightblue\") +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel() +\n  labs(title = \"geom_polygon()\") +\n  theme_minimal_grid()\n\nggplot(df, aes(x, y, label = label)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel() +\n  labs(title = \"geom_line()\") +\n  theme_minimal_grid()\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) geom_path()\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) geom_polygon()\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) geom_line()\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Explaining the difference betweeen geom_path(), geom_polygon() and geom_line()\n\n\n\nTo summarize, geom_path() connects points in the order they appear without necessarily forming closed shapes. geom_polygon() connects points in the order they appear and fills the area inside, creating closed shapes. geom_line() is used for creating line charts to represent trends or connections between data points.\n\nWhat low-level geoms are used to draw geom_smooth()? What about geom_boxplot() and geom_violin()?\nIn ggplot2, the geom_smooth(), geom_boxplot(), and geom_violin() geoms are high-level geoms that are built on top of lower-level geoms to create their respective visual representations. Here are the low-level geoms used to draw each of these high-level geoms:\n\n\ngeom_smooth():\n\n\ngeom_smooth() is used to add a smoothed line to a scatterplot. It’s commonly used for visualizing trends or relationships in data.\nThus, it can be seen as a collection of a very large number of very short lines connecting points calculated by loess() smoother function.\nHence, the low-level geoms used for creating the smoothed lines is geom_line().\n\n\n\ngeom_boxplot():\n\n\ngeom_boxplot() is used to create boxplots that display the distribution of data in a visually concise way.\nThe low-level geom used to draw the\n\nboxes in a boxplot: geom_rect()\n\nwhiskers in a boxplot: geom_line()\n\noutliers in a boxplot: geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_violin():\n\n\ngeom_violin() is used to create violin plots that visualize the distribution of data in a way that combines aspects of a box plot and a kernel density plot.\nAfter calculating the exact points which define the boundaries of a violin, the low-level geom used to draw the violin shapes is geom_polygon()."

Once particularly nice one is facet_zoom() as depicted in Figure 4 .

We can zoom in on either the x-axis, the y-axis, or both simultaneously.\n\nCodelibrary(ggforce)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\n\nflights |&gt; \n  filter(carrier == \"AA\" & month == 1) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = dep_delay,\n             y = arr_delay)) +\n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.2) +\n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, col = \"red\") + \n  facet_zoom(y = arr_delay &lt; 0,\n             x = dep_delay &lt; 0) + \n  labs(y = \"Arrival Delay (minutes)\", x = \"Departure Delay (minutes)\")\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Use of facet_zoom() to show that relation between Departure Delay and Arrival Delay of American Airlines flights holds true even for flights landing earlier than scheduled\n\n\n\nAnother nice one is facet_wrap_paginate() which enables you to break down a faceted plot into multiple pages. You can specify the number of rows and columns per page, along with the page number you want to plot. The function will automatically generate only the appropriate panels. The Figure 5 shows an example with a for(){} loop.\n\nCodefor (i in 1:2) {\n\n  print(\n    flights |&gt; \n      filter(carrier == \"AA\") |&gt;\n      ggplot(aes(x = dep_time, \n                 y = dep_delay)) +\n      geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1, \n                 shape = 19) +\n      geom_smooth(col = \"red\") +\n      facet_wrap_paginate(~ month,\n                          nrow = 3,\n                          ncol = 2,\n                          scales = \"free_y\",\n                          page = i) +\n      scale_x_continuous(limits = c(500, 2400)) +\n      theme_classic() +\n      labs(x = \"Departure Time (hrs)\", y = \"Departure delay (min.)\")\n  )\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) First half of the year: Jan-Jun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Second half of the year: Jul-Dec\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Use of facet_wrap_paginate() to create plots of realtion between American Airlines flights’ departure time and departure delay for different months"

    "text": "Apart from the US, most countries use fuel consumption (fuel consumed over fixed distance) rather than fuel economy (distance travelled with fixed amount of fuel). How could you convert cty and hwy into the European standard of l/100km?\nIn the R formula, we convert miles per gallon (mpg) to liters per 100 kilometers (L/100km). The conversion factor, 235.21, is used to perform the conversion. To convert mpg to L/100km, we divide the conversion factor by the mpg value.\n\\[ \\text{L/100km} = \\frac{235.21}{\\text{mpg}}  \\tag{1}\\] The conversion factor of 235.21 is derived from the following logic:\n\n1 mile is equal to approximately 1.609 kilometers.\n1 gallon is equal to approximately 3.785 liters.\n\nTo convert from miles per gallon (mpg) to liters per 100 kilometers (L/100km), we need to reverse the units. So, we divide the number of miles (1 mile) by the number of gallons (1 gallon) to get the number of kilometers per liter. This can be expressed as:\n\\[ \\text{Kilometers per Liter} = \\frac{1 \\text{ mile}}{1 \\text{ gallon}} \\times \\frac{1.609 \\text{ kilometers}}{1 \\text{ mile}} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ liter}}{3.785 \\text{ gallons}} \\approx 0.4251 \\text{ kilometers per liter}  \\tag{2}\\]\nNow, to express fuel efficiency in liters per 100 kilometers, we need to scale up by 100:\n\\[ \\text{L/100km} = \\frac{1}{0.4251} \\times 100 \\approx 235.21 \\text{ L/100km per 1 kilometer per liter}  \\tag{3}\\]\nSo, when you divide 235.21 by miles per gallon (mpg), you are effectively converting from miles per gallon to liters per 100 kilometers, accounting for the differences in units and scaling by 100 to express the consumption over a distance of 100 kilometers.\nNow, you can include the R code and LaTeX explanation in an R Markdown document for a more structured presentation. When you knit the R Markdown document, it will generate a formatted document with both the code and explanations.\n\nCode# Conversion factor from mpg to L/100km\nconversion_factor &lt;- 235.21\n\nmpg |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    cty = conversion_factor/cty,\n    hwy = conversion_factor/hwy\n  ) |&gt; \n  slice_head(n = 5) |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; gtExtras::gt_theme_538() |&gt; \n  fmt_number(columns = cty:hwy,\n             decimals = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1:  mpg dataset with mileage in Liters per 100 km \n  \nmanufacturer\n      model\n      displ\n      year\n      cyl\n      trans\n      drv\n      cty\n      hwy\n      fl\n      class\n    \n\n\naudi\na4\n1.8\n1999\n4\nauto(l5)\nf\n13.07\n8.11\np\ncompact\n\n\naudi\na4\n1.8\n1999\n4\nmanual(m5)\nf\n11.20\n8.11\np\ncompact\n\n\naudi\na4\n2.0\n2008\n4\nmanual(m6)\nf\n11.76\n7.59\np\ncompact\n\n\naudi\na4\n2.0\n2008\n4\nauto(av)\nf\n11.20\n7.84\np\ncompact\n\n\naudi\na4\n2.8\n1999\n6\nauto(l5)\nf\n14.70\n9.05\np\ncompact"

    "text": "Question 2\nWhat does ggplot(mpg, aes(model, manufacturer)) + geom_point() show? Is it useful? How could you modify the data to make it more informative?\nThe code ggplot(mpg, aes(model, manufacturer)) + geom_point() is used to create a scatter plot, where the mpg dataset is being used, and it’s mapping the model variable to the x-axis and the manufacturer variable to the y-axis. The geom_point() function is responsible for adding points to the plot.\n\nCodeggplot(mpg, aes(model, manufacturer)) + geom_point()\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Plot produced by the code given in Question 2\n\n\n\nHere’s a detailed explanation of why this code and its resulting Figure 2 isn’t useful:\n\n\nData Mapping:\n\n\nmodel is mapped to the x-axis: The car models don’t have a specific order, i.e. it is a categorical variable, not an ordinal or continuous variable.\n\nmanufacturer is mapped to the y-axis: Again, manufacturer is a categorical variable with no specific order. Thus, representing it on y-axis is not advisable.\n\n\n\nVisualization:\n\nThe plot will consist of multiple points where each point represents a combination of a car model and its manufacturer. As, we can expect, each observation will have a unique model. There is no specific information or pattern being displayed as scatter plot doesn’t connect the points.\nThe plot suffers from over-plotting if there are many data points when a single model has many variants (alpha aesthetic has not been defined here). Further, since each unique model and manufacturer combination will be displayed as a separate point, it is difficult to discern patterns or relationships.\nThus, this plot has very limited usefulness is identifying trends or make specific insights.\n\n\n\nModifications for More Informativeness: To make the plot more informative, you can consider the following modifications:\n\n\nChanging the plot geom: If our purpose is to show the number of model variants for each manufacturer, we might shift to a bar plot, with faceting on the manufacturer as shown in Figure 3 .\n\nCodempg |&gt; \n\n  # Counting number of variants for each model\n  count(manufacturer, model) |&gt; \n\n  # Nicer looking names\n  mutate(manufacturer = snakecase::to_title_case(manufacturer),\n         model = snakecase::to_title_case(model, numerals = \"left\")) |&gt; \n\n  # Plot\n  ggplot(aes(x = n, \n             y = manufacturer,\n             group = model, \n             fill = manufacturer)) +\n\n  # Grouped bar chart\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge2\",\n           stat = \"identity\") +\n\n  # Adding names of models\n  geom_text(aes(label = model,\n                x = 0),\n            position = position_dodge2(width = 1),\n            hjust = \"left\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\n        legend.position = \"none\",\n        plot.title.position = \"plot\") +\n  labs(y = NULL, x = NULL,\n       title = \"Number of model variants for manufacturers in mpg dataset\")\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Grouped horizontal bar plot showing number of variants for different car models in mpg dataset\n\n\n\n\n\nLabels, Title, Color and Size Aesthetics: If we insist on using the same plot as given in the question, we can use additional aesthetics like color or point size to encode more information. For instance, you could use color to represent a third variable, such as “class” (economy, midsize, compact, etc.), and point size to represent another variable, like “displacement.” We can further sort the manufacturers and models alphabetically.\n\nCode# Create some factors to order the manufacturers and model names in a specific order\nman_lev &lt;- mpg |&gt; \n  distinct(manufacturer) |&gt; pull(manufacturer)\n\nmod_lev &lt;- mpg |&gt; \n  group_by(manufacturer) |&gt; \n  arrange(manufacturer, model) |&gt; pull(model) |&gt; unique()\n\n# Start the plot\nmpg |&gt; \n\n  # reorder the manufacturers by alphabetically and models by numbers\n    mutate(\n    manufacturer = fct(manufacturer, levels = man_lev),\n    model = fct(model, levels = mod_lev)\n  ) |&gt; \n\n  # Create the same scatter plot, adding size and color aesthetic\n    ggplot(aes(x = model,\n             y = manufacturer,\n             size = displ,\n             col = manufacturer)) +\n\n  # A geom_jitter instead of geom_point to avoid overlap of variants of a model\n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3,\n              width = 0,\n              height = 1) +\n\n  # Plot beautification and customization\n\n  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, \n                                   hjust = 1,\n                                   vjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Adding other informative aesthetics to the points in given plot\n\n\n\n\n\nThese modifications can help you gain more insight from your data and make your visualization more informative.

While this can provide a rich and detailed representation of your data, it can also lead to a plot that becomes too complex and difficult to perceive for several reasons:\n\nClutter: Multiple aesthetics, such as color, shape, size, and others, can lead to visual clutter, especially when you have a large dataset. This can make it challenging for viewers to discern patterns and relationships within the data.\nCognitive Overload: When a plot contains too many aesthetics, viewers may struggle to process the information efficiently. It requires more cognitive effort to interpret the various aesthetic mappings, leading to information overload.\nReduced Clarity: Complex plots can reduce the clarity and simplicity that is often desirable in data visualization. Clutter and complexity can obscure the main message you want to convey, making it harder for the audience to understand the key insights.\nColor Confusion: Overusing color can be particularly problematic. If multiple categories or variables are assigned distinct colors, it can be challenging to differentiate between them, especially if some colors are similar or hard to distinguish.\nInterference: When multiple aesthetics are used, there’s a potential for interference or overlap between different visual elements. For example, if you use both color and size aesthetics, larger points with different colors may overlap, making it challenging to discern individual points.\nIneffectiveness: Sometimes, adding multiple aesthetics may not actually enhance the plot’s effectiveness or communicative power. Instead, it might complicate the plot without providing significant additional insights.\n\nTo avoid making a plot too complex and difficult to perceive, it’s essential to carefully consider the goals of your visualization and the message you want to convey. It’s often better to use a limited number of aesthetics thoughtfully, or using faceting."

    "text": "Question 2\nWhat happens if you map a continuous variable to shape? Why? What happens if you map trans to shape? Why?\nMapping a continuous variable to the shape aesthetic in ggplot2, it throws up an error, because, the shape aesthetic is designed for categorical variables, not continuous ones. When you attempt to deliberately map a continuous variable to shape, ggplot2 will, at best, treat it as a categorical variable, which can lead to unintended and potentially confusing results.\nLet’s consider both scenarios using the mpg dataset:\n\n\nMapping a Continuous Variable (e.g., displ) to Shape Aesthetic:\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, shape = displ)) + geom_point()\n\n# Error in `geom_point()`:\n# ! Problem while computing aesthetics.\n# ℹ Error occurred in the 1st layer.\n# Caused by error in `scale_f()`:\n# ! A continuous variable cannot be mapped to the shape aesthetic\n# ℹ choose a different aesthetic or use `scale_shape_binned()`\n# Run `rlang::last_trace()` to see where the error occurred.\nWhen you map a continuous variable like displ (engine displacement) to the shape aesthetic, ggplot2 will treat each unique value of ‘displ’ as a separate category and assign a different shape to each value. This can result in a plot with many unique shapes, which can be difficult to interpret. Thus, ggplot2 throws up an error. The shapes do not have any inherent order or meaning in this context, so the plot may not provide clear insights.\n\n\nMapping a Categorical Variable (e.g., trans) to Shape:\n\nCodeggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, shape = trans)) + geom_point()\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Mapping a Categorical Variable: Transmission (trans) to Shape aesthetic\n\n\n\nWhen you map a categorical variable like ‘trans’ (transmission type) to the shape aesthetic, ggplot2 assigns a unique shape to each category in the ‘trans’ variable. However, there are a limited number of shapes in ggplot2 and thus many shapes (like auto(s5) , auto(s6) , manual(m5) and manual(m6) ) go un-plotted thus leading to missing data. In any case, it is generally not advisable to plot more than 4-5 shapes in a plot to keep it nice and simple.\n\n\nIn summary, mapping a continuous variable to the shape aesthetic may not be possible. However, mapping a categorical variable to shape can be useful, provided the number of categories is not too much."

    "text": "Question 1\nWhat happens if you try to facet by a continuous variable like hwy? What about cyl? What’s the key difference?\nIn ggplot2, faceting is a way to create small multiples, or a grid of plots, based on the values of a categorical variable. When you try to facet by a continuous variable like “hwy” or a discrete (but not necessarily categorical) variable like “cyl” using the facet_grid() or facet_wrap() functions, there are some key differences in how the faceting works:\n\n\nFaceting by a Continuous Variable (e.g., hwy):\n\nIdeally, faceting by a continuous variable should not be attempted and should throw up an error, simply because a continuous variable can theoretically have an infinite number of levels. However, if ggplot2 finds that the continuous variable we have supplied to facet_wrap() has many values, it still tries and produces a facet for each unique value as shown in Figure 7.\nHence, we see in Figure 7 that if you try to facet by a continuous variable like “hwy”, ggplot2 will attempt to treat each unique value of the continuous variable as a separate facet. This can lead to a large number of facets, making the resulting plot potentially difficult to interpret or too cluttered.\nLastly, faceting by a continuous variable is generally not very useful, and it’s usually better to use continuous variables as aesthetic mappings for scales or other plot features.\n\n\n\n\nCodempg |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = displ,\n             y = hwy)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  facet_wrap(~ hwy, nrow = 4)\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Faceting on a continuous variable hwy in the mpg dataset\n\n\n\n\n\nFaceting by a Discrete Variable (e.g., “cyl”):\n\nWhen you facet by a discrete variable like “cyl” ggplot2 will create one facet for each unique value of the discrete variable, as shown in Figure 8 .\nFaceting by discrete variables is a common and useful way to explore the relationships between variables based on different categories. It helps you create a grid of plots where each facet represents a distinct category, allowing for easy visual comparison.\nThe key difference is that discrete variables are intended for faceting, while continuous variables are not.

How does faceting by number of cylinders change your assessement of the relationship between engine size and fuel economy?\nAs observed in the Figure 9, a three-way connection exists between fuel efficiency, the number of cylinders, and engine size. It’s evident that as the engine displacement in liters rises, fuel economy declines, indicating an inverse relationship. This correlation remains consistent for both city and highway mileage across 4, 5, and 6-cylinder engines.\nIn contrast, when considering 8-cylinder engines, the relationship is different. Notably, for 8-cylinder engines, mileage improves as engine size increases (possibly due to the enhanced quality of larger engines).\nThus, faceting by number of cylinders changed our assessment of the relationship between engine size and fuel economy by bringing out the different relation when seeing the facet of 8-cylinder cars.

    "text": "Question 4\nWhat does the scales argument to facet_wrap() do? When might you use it?\nThe scales argument in the facet_wrap() function in ggplot2 is used to control how the scales for the facets are handled. It allows you to specify how the axes (x and y scales) should be shared or scaled among the facets in the grid. The scales argument can take one of the following values:\n\n\"fixed\": This is the default behavior. It means that the scales for each facet are shared, and they are based on the range of data overall across facets. This results in a common scale across facets.\n\"free_x\": This option allows the x-axis (horizontal scale) to vary independently for each facet, but the y-axis (vertical scale) is shared among all facets. This is useful when you want to compare different facets on a common y-axis scale while allowing the x-axis to adjust to the data in each facet.\n\"free_y\": This option allows the y-axis (vertical scale) to vary independently for each facet, but the x-axis (horizontal scale) is shared among all facets. This is useful when you want to compare different facets on a common x-axis scale while allowing the y-axis to adjust to the data in each facet.\n\"free\": This option allows both the x-axis and y-axis to vary independently for each facet, meaning that neither axis is shared among facets. This is useful when you want complete independence in scaling for both axes across facets.\n\nYou might use the scales argument when you have facets that contain different data ranges, and you want to control how the scales are shared or adjusted among those facets. It’s particularly useful when creating faceted plots with facets that have different data distributions, and you want to ensure that certain facets share a common scale for meaningful visual comparisons while allowing other scales to adjust independently.\nFor example, if you have different facets representing data for various products and you want to compare their sales over time, you might use \"free_y\" to have a common time scale (x-axis) while allowing the y-axis scale for sales to adapt to each product’s data range. This way, you can easily compare sales trends across products over the same time period.\nHere’s an example using plots from previous question: –\n\nCodep &lt;- mpg |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = displ,\n             y = hwy)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_classic() +\n  labs(x = \"Engine Displacement, in litres\",\n       y = \"Fuel Economy, Highway (miles per gallon)\")\n\np + facet_wrap(~ cyl, ncol = 4) +\n  labs(title = \"Fixed scales with 4 columns\")\n\np + facet_wrap(~ cyl, ncol = 4,\n               scales = \"free_x\") +\n  labs(title = \"Using scales as \\\"free_x\\\" with 4 columns\")\n\np + facet_wrap(~ cyl, nrow = 4) +\n  labs(title = \"Fixed scales with 4 rows\")\n\np + facet_wrap(~ cyl, nrow = 4,\n               scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(title = \"Using scales as \\\"free_y\\\" with 4 rows\")\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Using facet_wrap(~ cyl, ncol = 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Using facet_wrap(~ cyl, ncol = 4, scales = free_x)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Using facet_wrap(~ cyl, nrow = 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Using facet_wrap(~ cyl, nrow = 4, scales = free_y)\n\n\n\nFigure 11: A scatter plot of highway mileage vs. engine displacement, faceted by number of cylinders - to demonstrate the purpose of scales argument to facet_wrap()"

Which of the geoms described above is most effective at remedying the problem?\nThe problem with the plot, as shown in Figure 12 sub-plot (a) is overplotting. Overplotting is a common issue in data visualization, especially when creating scatter plots in ggplot2. It occurs when multiple data points are plotted at the same (or very similar) coordinates on a plot, making it difficult to distinguish individual points. This often happens when you have a large dataset, or when the data points are highly concentrated in a small area.\nWhen you use geom_point() to plot data points that overlap or cluster together, the result can be a plot that shows points stacked on top of each other, as in Figure 12 sub-plot (a), making it hard to see the density and distribution of the data.\nThe two possible solutions to overplotting are: –\n\ngeom_jitter() - better when there are fewer observations, and exact data distribution is not important.\nalpha argument with geom_point() - better when there are many observations; and, when data distribution is important.\ndensity plots (stat_bin2d()) or hexbin plots (stat_binhex())- when there are just too many observations, say more than 1000 or so.\n\nThe most most effective at remedying the problem here is geom_jitter() . The geom_jitter() adds a small amount of random noise to the x and y coordinates of each data point, which helps spread out the points and make them more distinguishable. Here’s how geom_jitter() works:\n\nIt takes the original data points and adds random variations to their positions. By default, the random noise is drawn from a uniform distribution.\nYou can control the amount of jitter (spread) by adjusting the width argument, which specifies the maximum distance the points can be jittered.\n\n\nCodeggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) + geom_point() + \n  theme_minimal() + labs(x = \"City Mileage (miles per gallon)\",\n                         y = \"Highway mileage (miles per gallon)\")\n\nggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) + geom_jitter() + \n  theme_minimal() + labs(x = \"City Mileage (miles per gallon)\",\n                         y = \"Highway mileage (miles per gallon)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) The plot using code given in the question\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Improved plot using geom_jitter()\n\n\n\nFigure 12: A figure depicting the problem of overplotting and how to resolve it"

How could you change the factor levels to be more informative?\nYes, the ordering of class is alphabetical, and this is not useful because as we observe in sub-plot (a) of Figure 13 the un-ordered class of vehicles on x-axis make it tough to discern a pattern in the highway mileage. We could change the factor levels by increasing values of mean of hwy (highway miles per gallon). This can be done with fct_relevel() manually.\nRather than reordering the factor by hand, you can do it automatically based on the data: ggplot(mpg, aes(reorder(class, hwy), hwy)) + geom_boxplot(). What does reorder() do? Read the documentation.\nAn improved version of the plot, much easier to interpret and observe the trends is shown in sub-plot (b) of Figure 13 . Ordering the categorical variable class on x-axis by increasing hwy allows us to easily see which cars are most fuel efficient and which are not.\nIn R, the reorder() function is used to reorder the levels of a factor or to reorder the categories of a discrete variable within a data frame or a vector based on the values of another variable. It is a handy function for controlling the order in which categorical variables are displayed in plots, tables, and other visualizations.\nThe typical usage of reorder() is as follows:\nreorder(x, X, FUN = NULL)\n\n\nx: This is the factor or vector whose levels you want to reorder.\n\nX: This is the variable that you want to use to determine the new order of the levels of x.\n\nFUN: This is an optional argument that specifies a summary function to be applied to X. It is used to calculate a summary value of X for each level of x, and then reorder the levels based on these summary values. If FUN is not specified, X is assumed to be a single numeric or integer variable.\n\nA reordered factor can be useful when creating plots, such as bar charts or box plots, where you want the categories to be sorted based on a particular variable, making it easier to see the relationships between variables, as shown in Figure 13 .\n\nCodeggplot(mpg, aes(class, hwy)) + geom_boxplot() + \n  theme_minimal() + labs(x = \"Class of vehicle\", \n                         y = \"Highway mileage (miles per gallon)\")\n\nggplot(mpg, aes(reorder(class, hwy), hwy)) + geom_boxplot() +\n    theme_minimal() + labs(x = \"Class of vehicle\", \n                         y = \"Highway mileage (miles per gallon)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Box-plot without ordering the x-axis variable\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Box-plot with ordered x-axis variable, based on values of y-axis variable\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Ordering a categorical variable to make the plot easier to visualize and interpret"

What does the weight aesthetic do?\nIn ggplot2, the weight aesthetic in geom_bar serves the purpose of facilitating the creation of bar charts that display counts or sums of weights rather than the traditional count of observations. When you use geom_bar() with the weight aesthetic, it modifies the height of the bars to be proportional to the sum of the supplied weights for each group. This allows you to create bar charts where the bar height represents the accumulated sum of a specific variable, rather than just the count of instances. The Figure 22 is an excellent example usign both methods - dplyr data wrangling Figure 22 (a) and the geom_bar() with weight aesthetic Figure 22 (b) - both witht he same result to explain the purpose.\nIn essence, the weight aesthetic in geom_bar() offers the flexibility to create weighted histograms and barcharts, where the bar heights no longer represent a simple count of observations but instead reflect the cumulative sum of a different variable.\nThis functionality is particularly useful when you want to visualize data with varying weights or magnitudes, emphasizing the overall importance of a particular variable within each group.\n\nCodediamonds |&gt; \n  group_by(cut) |&gt; \n  summarise(price_total = sum(price),\n            n = n()) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = cut, y = price_total)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(x = \"Cut\",\n       y = \"Price (in million $)\",\n       title = \"Plot using dplyr wrangling\") +\n  theme_minimal_hgrid() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_number_si())\n\ndiamonds |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = cut, \n             weight = price)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"Cut\",\n       y = \"Price (in million $)\",\n       title = \"Plot using geom_bar and weight aesthetic\") +\n  theme_minimal_hgrid() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_number_si())\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Using the dplyr data wrangling to find sum of prices and then plotting\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Using the weight aesthetic in geom_bar()\n\n\n\nFigure 22: Demonstrating the total prices of all diamonds of each cut in the diamonds data-set"

    "text": "Question 3\nWhen illustrating the difference between mapping continuous and discrete colours to a line, the discrete example needed aes(group = 1). Why? What happens if that is omitted? What’s the difference between aes(group = 1) and aes(group = 2)? Why?\nIn ggplot2, when dealing with discrete variables or combinations of them in a plot, each one is considered a separate group. So, if we use a discrete variable to set the color (like factor(colour)), ggplot2 creates a distinct line for each group, which corresponds to each separate color. In your case, there’s only one observation for each color, so no lines are drawn, as you can see in Figure 3 (a).\nOn the other hand, if we set the group = 1, we’re essentially making a new group. This group will include all observations, because the number 1 is just a numeric value and not a grouping variable in the dataset. Consequently, all observations are treated as a single group, and a line is drawn using the color from the previous observation. This means that the line segment from (1,1) going to (2,2) will have the same color as the point (1,1), as demonstrated in Figure 3 (b).\nSimilarly, if we set the group = 2, we get the same result as in Figure 3 (b) because 2 is another numeric value (just like 1) that is not a variable in the dataset. So, again, all observations are treated as a single group, and the line segment from (2,2) to (3,3) takes its color from the point (2,2), as illustrated in Figure 3 (c).\nIn both cases (aes(group = 1) and aes(group = 2), the line segments will have the same colours, and the difference is essentially in the numeric identifier used for grouping, which doesn’t affect the final outcome in this context. The purpose of using these numeric values (1 or 2) as the grouping variable is to ensure that all data points are connected in a continuous line with consistent color, regardless of the color mapping in your ggplot2 plot.\n\nCode# Re-Creating the data frame given in text-book\ndf &lt;- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = 1:3, colour = c(1, 3, 5))\n\nggplot(df, aes(x, y, colour = factor(colour))) + \n  geom_line(linewidth = 2) +\n  geom_point(size = 5)\n\nggplot(df, aes(x, y, colour = factor(colour))) + \n  geom_line(aes(group = 1), \n            linewidth = 2) +\n  geom_point(size = 5)\n\nggplot(df, aes(x, y, colour = factor(colour))) + \n  geom_line(aes(group = 2), \n            linewidth = 2) +\n  geom_point(size = 5)\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Base code, no group aesthetic mapped to geom_line\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) geom_line(aes(group = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) geom_line(aes(group = 2))\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Illustrating the difference between mapping continuous and discrete colours to a line"

    "text": "Question 4\nHow many bars are in each of the following plots?\n(Hint: try adding an outline around each bar with colour = \"white\")\nLets examine each of the plots. The reasoning and answers are given below, and the resulting plots are in Figure 4 .\n\n\nggplot(mpg, aes(drv)) + geom_bar()\nThis plot should produce as many bars as there are values/levels of drv .Thus, this plot should produce 3 bars [n_distinct(mpg$drv)] The reason is that drv is the only aesthetic, and it is a discrete variable, so geoms are automatically grouped by the discrete variable. The resulting plot is in Figure 4 (a) .\n\n\nggplot(mpg, aes(drv, fill = hwy, group = hwy)) + geom_bar()\nThis plot should produce stacked bar-plot of up-to 3 X 27 = 81 bars. That is, total 3 bar plots (one for each level of discrete variable drv), each bar containing up-to 27 smaller bars (one for each value of the group aesthetic group = hwy. The number 27 comes from n_distinct(mpg$hwy). However, some values of hwy may be missin for each level of drv . Thus, the actual number of bars within the 3 stacked bar-plots will be 46 [nrow(count(mpg, drv, hwy))]. The color of the bars will be along a sequential colour palette since ggplot2 will treat the variable hwy as a continuous variable, and thus plot colours in a continuum sequence. The resulting plot is shown in Figure 4 (b) . To make it easier to vizualize the number of stacks, the white outlined plot is shown on Figure 5 (b) .\n\n\nggplot(mpg2, aes(drv, fill = hwy, group = id)) + geom_bar()\nThis code should now produce 234 [n_distinct(mpg2$id)] different small bars stacked into 3 big bars - one for each drv category. Each small bar will represent an observation, and its colour will depend on the value of hwy for the observation, and that too in ascending order. This is because while allotting id you had arranged the observations in ascending order of hwy. The Figure 4 (c) shows the plot. Since the colour changes are too frequent, an easier visualization showing number of stacks is in Figure 5 (c).\n\n\n\nCodeggplot(mpg, aes(drv)) + geom_bar()\n\n\nggplot(mpg, aes(drv, fill = hwy, group = hwy)) + geom_bar()\n\nmpg2 &lt;- mpg %&gt;% arrange(hwy) %&gt;% mutate(id = seq_along(hwy)) \nggplot(mpg2, aes(drv, fill = hwy, group = id)) + \n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) ggplot(mpg, aes(drv)) + geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) ggplot(mpg, aes(drv, fill = hwy, group = hwy)) + geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) ggplot(mpg2, aes(drv, fill = hwy, group = id)) + geom_bar()\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The plots produced by code given above in answer to Question No. 4\n\n\n\n\nCodeggplot(mpg, aes(drv)) + geom_bar(col = \"white\")\n\n\nggplot(mpg, aes(drv, fill = hwy, group = hwy)) + geom_bar(col = \"white\")\n\nmpg2 &lt;- mpg %&gt;% arrange(hwy) %&gt;% mutate(id = seq_along(hwy)) \nggplot(mpg2, aes(drv, fill = hwy, group = id)) + \n  geom_bar(col = \"white\")\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) ggplot(mpg, aes(drv)) + geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) ggplot(mpg, aes(drv, fill = hwy, group = hwy)) + geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) ggplot(mpg2, aes(drv, fill = hwy, group = id)) + geom_bar()\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Same bar plots, now with white outlines to show the numbers easily"

Given that price is a continuous variable and clarity is a categorical / discrete variable, various graphical representations can be employed for analysis.

Furthermore, at higher clarity levels, the right-skewness becomes more pronounced, indicating a scarcity of highly priced diamonds within each clarity tier.\nThe data suggests a consistent right-skewed pattern across all clarity levels, with a notable intensification of skewness at higher clarity levels.

This package allows us to create interactive (with shiny) and dynamic (as shown below) ggplot2 visualizations, primarily through the incorporation of HTML and JavaScript elements.\nWith ggiraph, you can add interactivity to various ggplot2 charts, such as scatter plots, bar charts, and maps, enabling users to hover over elements for additional information, click on points of interest, and explore data in a more engaging manner. The interactivity is achieved by leveraging the capabilities of web technologies, making it particularly useful for creating interactive graphics for online presentations or dashboards. You can customize tooltips, add hyperlinks, and create interactive legends, providing a versatile tool for data exploration and communication.
