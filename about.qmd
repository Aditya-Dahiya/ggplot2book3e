Welcome to my [little corner](https://aditya-dahiya.github.io/) of the internet! I’m Dr. Aditya Dahiya, your friendly neighborhood data enthusiast. With an [MBBS](https://www.scribd.com/document/52499148/Hybrid-Hues-Final) from [AIIMS, New Delhi](https://www.aiims.edu/index.php/en) and a Master of Public Health from [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/), I’ve always had a penchant for diving deep into the intricacies of data—and what better way to do that than with [**`ggplot2`**](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)?

When I’m not navigating the labyrinth of Haryana's bureaucracy (don’t worry, I have a map!), I channel my experiences as a [Fulbright Fellow](https://www.usief.org.in/Fellowships/Fulbright-Nehru-Master-Fellowships.aspx) into making data visualization a captivating storytelling tool. Think of me as your data-wrangling, file-taming, bureaucracy-battling guide with a slightly skewed sense of humor. Need more bureaucratic banter or data insights? Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-aditya-dahiya-ias/) or shoot me an [email](mailto:%20adityadahiyaaiims@proton.me) — I promise it won't be as formal as a governme
