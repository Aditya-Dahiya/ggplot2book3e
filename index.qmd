Welcome to the Solutions Manual and much more for the [third edition](https://ggplot2-book.org/ "ggplot2 Book (3rd Edition)") of **ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis (3e)** by [Hadley Wickham](https://hadley.nz/), [Danielle Navarro](https://djnavarro.net/), and [Thomas Lin Pedersen](https://www.data-imaginist.com/).

This manual is your indispensable companion for this amazing book on `ggplot2` and `R` graphics.

Inside these pages, you'll find a rich trove of techniques to extend the extra-ordinary capabilities to `ggplot2` and other packages developed by amazing people all over the world to solve the exercises given in the book, and extend them beyond to improve the output.

I emphasize not just the ***solving the exercises,*** but extending ggplot2 capabilities with add-on packages such as [`gganimate`](https://gganimate.com/) , [`ggthemes`](https://yutannihilation.github.io/allYourFigureAreBelongToUs/ggthemes/) , [`ggplotly`](https://plotly.com/ggplot2/) , [`patchwork`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) , [`gridExtra`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gridExtra/index.html) , [`ggrepel`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggrepel/vignettes/ggrepel.html) , [`GGally`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GGally/index.html#:~:text='GGally'%20extends%20'ggplot2',several%20functions%20to%20plot%20networks.) , [`ggcorrplot`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggcorrplot/readme/README.html) , [`ggmap`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggmap/readme/README.html) , and, the various extensions to ggplot2 at the [**`ggplot2`** extensions](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) webpage.

This website is committed to fostering a collaborative learning environment and offers all it's code and solutions for free. Happy learning!
