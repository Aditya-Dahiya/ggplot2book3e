::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
This Chapter has no exercises to solve, so I use various datasets to explore and customize colour scales and legends in `ggplot2`.
:::

For this Chapter, let's use the [data](#0 "What We Watched: A Netflix Engagement Report") on Engagement (Hours Watched) report from [Netflix](#0) which lists, in descending order, all 18,000+ titles viewed for 50,000+ hours on the platform in the first half of 2023. Credits to the [Data is Plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com/) podcast by [Jeremy Singer-Vine](#0) for circulating this data-set.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(ggwordcloud)
library(lubridate)

set.seed(42)
netflix <- read_csv(here::here("data", "netflix.csv")) |> 
  slice_head(n = 100) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  select(1:3) |> 
  mutate(title = str_remove_all(title, "[^[\\da-zA-Z ]]")) |> 
  mutate(title = str_replace(title, "\\s{3,}.*", "")) |> 
  mutate(month = floor_date(release_date, unit = "month"),
         year = year(release_date))
```

# **11.2 Continuous colour scales**

For depicting use of continuous color scales, we use the [dataset](https://github.com/HarshaDevulapalli/indian-movie-theatres/blob/master/indian-movie-theatres.csv) by [Harsha Devulapalli](https://github.com/HarshaDevulapalli) on [Movie Theaters](https://github.com/HarshaDevulapalli/indian-movie-theatres) in 8 Indian metropolitan Cities. Credits to the [Data is Plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com/) podcast by [Jeremy Singer-Vine](#0) for circulating this data-set.

# **11.3 Discrete colour scales**

Now, I use the data-set with `ggwordcloud` [@ggwordcloud] to make word-clouds of top Netflix Titles. The @fig-default shows the top 10 titles on Netflix by number of hours viewed between January - June 2023, with default colour schemes in ggplot2.

```{r}
#| label: fig-default
#| fig-cap: "Top 10 titles on Netflix by number of hours viewed: January - June 2023"
#| fig-subcap: 
#|   - "A horizontal Bar-Chart"
#|   - "A wordcloud"

g1 <- netflix |> 
  slice_max(order_by = hours_viewed, n = 10) |> 
  ggplot(aes(
    x = hours_viewed, 
    y = reorder(title, hours_viewed),
    fill = title,
    label = title)) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(aes(x = 0),
            hjust = "inward",
            vjust = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Hours viewed on Netflix", y = NULL,
       title = "Top 10 titles on Netflix",
       subtitle = "By number of hours viewed: January - June 2023") +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(0),
                     labels = scales::label_number_si()) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank())

g2 <- netflix |> 
  mutate(title = str_replace(title, " Season\\s.*", "")) |> 
  slice_max(order_by = hours_viewed, n = 40) |> 
  ggplot(aes(label = title, 
             size = hours_viewed,
             color = hours_viewed)) +
  geom_text_wordcloud(shape = "circle") +
  scale_size_area(max_size = unit(10, "mm")) +
  labs(title = "Word cloud of top 30 titles on Netflix (Jan-Jun 2023)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

g1
g2
```

The @fig-default2 shows the same plots with `paletteer` [@paletteer] scales.

```{r}
#| label: fig-default2
#| fig-cap: "Top 10 titles on Netflix by number of hours viewed: January - June 2023"
#| fig-subcap: 
#|   - "A horizontal Bar-Chart"
#|   - "A wordcloud"

library(paletteer)

g1 + scale_fill_paletteer_d("ggthemes::Winter")

g2 + scale_color_paletteer_c("oompaBase::redscale")
```

## Some Packages for colour palettes in `R`
